# Museum_Django_Web Milestone 3

Many museums have established their museum databases, hold digital exhibitions, and provided virtual visit services to internet tourists. However, despite the museumsâ€™ great efforts, the benefits of these services do not reach everyone. I would like to build a museum-related website based on various museum data sets that provides users a quick search on Eastern Asian Culture. 

## Databases
Followings are the database that I would like to utilize (their websites can also be referred as similar websites):
1. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Washington, D.C., United States 
    - Website: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search
    - API: https://metmuseum.github.io/
2. Brooklyn Museum, New York, United States
    - Website: https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/
    - API: https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/api/v2/ S

## Data Structure
Followings are the data that the collection related dataset would like to store.

| Country     | string | China, Japan, Mongolia or Korea                                                                                             |
| Category    | string | The classification of the object                                                                                            |

In detail, there will be six table: Collection(id, title, date, image, description), Museum(id, name), Country(id, name), Category(id, name), Artist(id, name), User(id, nickname, comments, rating, collection)

## User Interaction
I would like to let users use manually created accounts or use a Google social login. In the website they can make comments, collect and rank on the collections.
