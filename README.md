# Museum_Django_Web

Many museums have established their museum databases, hold digital exhibitions, and provided virtual visit services to internet tourists. However, despite the museums’ great efforts, the benefits of these services do not reach everyone. I would like to build a museum-related website based on various museum data sets that provides users a quick search on Eastern Asian Culture. 

## Databases
Followings are the database that I would like to utilize (their websites can also be referred as similar websites):
1. The British Museum, London, United Kingdom
    - Website: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection
2. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Washington, D.C., United States 
    - Website: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search
    - API: https://metmuseum.github.io/
3. Brooklyn Museum, New York, United States
    - Website: https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/
    - API: https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/api/v2/ 

## Data Structure
Followings are the data that the collection related dataset would like to store.

| Country     | string | China, Japan, Mongolia or Korea                                                                                             |   |   |

In detail, there will be six table: Collection(id, title, date, image, description), Museum(id, name), Country(id, name), Category(id, name), Artist(id, name), User(id, nickname, comments, rating, collection)

## User Interaction
I would like to let users use manually created accounts or use a Google social login. In the website they can make comments, collect and rank on the collections.
